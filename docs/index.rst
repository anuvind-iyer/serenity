Serenity is a Python 3.x-based, open source trading system. It supports both tick-by-tick style reactive programming
and a more traditional strategy authoring approach that's more oriented toward investment strategies with longer time
horizons. You can use it for either cryptocurrency trading (live & backtest) or equity trading (backtest only at
this time).
